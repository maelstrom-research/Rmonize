# Background

Combining and co-analyzing data in a dossier offers potential advantages for 
addressing research questions, but data items collected in a dossier 
must first be made suitably equivalent, i.e., harmonized. This process of data 
harmonization is essential but challenging to implement in a rigorous and 
transparent way. To help address these challenges, 
<a href="https://www.maelstrom-research.org/" target="_blank"> Maelstrom Research</a>
developed guidelines for rigorous 
<a href="https://maelstrom-research.org/page/maelstrom-guidelines" target="_blank"> retrospective data harmonization</a>. An overview of the iterative steps of this process is shown 
in Figure 1.

# Rmonize

The **Rmonize** R package addresses practical aspects of data harmonization 
processing (guidelines Step 3) and facilitates evaluation (Step 4) and 
documentation (Step 5) of harmonization products. It was developed to meet 
the needs of Maelstromâ€™s collaborative harmonization initiatives, focusing on 
harmonization of individual participant data from population-based cohort 
studies, but is intended as a general resource for diverse harmonization 
efforts. **Rmonize** is compatible with the Maelstrom ObiBa software suite and 
other commonly used data management and statistical software.
