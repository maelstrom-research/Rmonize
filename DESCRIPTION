Description: Integrated tools to support rigorous and well documented data 
    harmonization based on Maelstrom Research guidelines. The package includes 
    functions to assess and prepare input elements, apply specified processing 
    rules to generate harmonized datasets, validate data processing and identify 
    processing errors, and document and summarize harmonized outputs. The 
    harmonization process is defined and structured by two key user-generated 
    documents: the DataSchema (specifying the list of harmonized variables to 
    generate across datasets) and the Data Processing Elements (specifying the 
    input elements and processing algorithms to generate harmonized variables 
    in DataSchema formats). The package was developed to address key  challenges 
    of retrospective data harmonization in epidemiology (as described in 
    Fortier I and al. (2017) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyw075>) but can be used for any 
    data harmonization initiative.
